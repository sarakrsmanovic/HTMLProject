                    <h2>About me:</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Sara, an experienced Chinese Translator with over 5 years of expertise in Chinese
                        (Simplified and Traditional) and English translations. I specialize in a variety of fields,
                        including legal, business, technical, and medical translations, as well as website localization.

                        I have worked with clients ranging from multinational companies to individuals, delivering
                        precise,
                        culturally relevant translations that meet their needs. My focus is on ensuring clarity,
                        accuracy,
                        and professionalism in every project, whether it’s a contract, marketing material, or medical
                        document.
                    </p>
                    <p>Why Choose Me?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Native Fluency in Chinese and English:</b> I am a native speaker of [Chinese/Simplified
                            or
                            Traditional Chinese] and am equally fluent in English. This gives me a deep understanding of
                            both languages' nuances, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Attention to Detail:</b> I take great care to ensure that every translation is not only
                            accurate but
                            also fluent and natural. My goal is to make sure that the translation feels as though it was
                            originally written in the target language.
                        </li>

                            why
                            I
                            pride myself on delivering high-quality translations on time. My clients can always count on
                            me
                            to meet deadlines without compromising quality.

                        <li>

                            needs and
                            goals. Whether it’s a one-off project or an ongoing collaboration, I always tailor my
                            services
                            to meet your requirements.

                        <li>
                            <b>Flexible Service:</b> From document translation to interpretation services, I offer a
                            wide
                            range
